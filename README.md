# TicTacToe in Bash
Used bash to implement an interactive game of "tic-tac-toe", sometimes also called "noughts and crosses". The game uses a 3x3 board. Each of two players places a mark on a square of the board. The first player uses the mark "X" (capital x) and the second player uses the mark "O" (capital o). "X" always goes first. The goal is for one of the players to place three marks in a row, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
* For background on the game, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe
